Spring is here, and Toon flowers are in full bloom. Wait, Toon flowers are always in full bloom, aren't they? Yes, they are when you have an Estate Garden (or when Daisy is around!).

If you haven't started an Estate Garden, then now's the time to get a jump on summer by purchasing a Gardening Kit from Clarabelle's Cattlelog. Plant some jellybeans to see which flowers bloom. Picking flowers increases your gardening skill -- and you can sell them to earn more jellybeans!

As your gardening skill increases, so does your ability to grow ever more elaborate flowers. You can even purchase advanced gardening supplies -- like a statue of your Toon. Plus, you can earn gardening trophies and get a boost to your overall Laff limit. So grab your Cattlelog, give Clarabelle a call -- and turn your white Toon gloves green with some Estate Gardening fun!
