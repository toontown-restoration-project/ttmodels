       \1blue\1Toons Love to Party!\2
It's been a month of Toon Parties, and one thing is very clear -- Toons love to party! Just check out these stats:
        - Over 72 million jellybens spent on Toon parties!
        - Over 4.5 million Toons launching out of Cannons!
        - Over 2 million Toons jumping on Trampolines!
Whew, that's a lot of Toon partying! But it's no wonder with so much to do -- like launching your Toon out of a Cannon, collecting jellybeans while on a Trampoline, or breaking out some super-sweet Toon moves on the Dance Floor -- all while making new friends!
If you haven't had a chance to party yet - what are you waiting for?!?!
