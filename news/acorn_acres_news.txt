The Toon Council thanks all the Toons who participated in the Acorn Acres April Invitational. We have completed tallying the results and are pleased to announce the winners. These 28 players are the Toons who got the most "holes-in-one" on each course, each day. Each will receive a copy of "Chip 'n' Dale's Rescue Rangers" Volume 1 3-Disc DVD!
